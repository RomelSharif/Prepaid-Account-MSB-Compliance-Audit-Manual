The Prepaid Account MSB Compliance Audit Manual is designed as a practical, structured guide to support auditors in evaluating Money Services Businesses (MSBs) that provide prepaid account services. It equips auditors with a complete toolkit of risk-based methodologies, checklists, and documentation standards, enabling them to conduct thorough and consistent compliance reviews.

The manual helps auditors by:

Standardizing audit practices – ensuring consistency across governance, AML/CFT, KYC, and consumer protection audits.

Enhancing risk identification – providing scoring models, red flags, and gap indicators to detect weak points in compliance programs.

Ensuring regulatory alignment – covering BSA, USA PATRIOT Act, AMLA, OFAC, FATF, CFPB, and state-level requirements.

Improving efficiency – offering step-by-step checklists and required document templates that streamline audit preparation and reporting.

Strengthening accountability – guiding auditors to verify not only the existence of policies but also their practical enforcement and cultural adoption within MSBs.

By using this manual, auditors gain a comprehensive framework that goes beyond regulatory checklists, enabling them to evaluate real-world compliance effectiveness, protect consumers, and uphold the integrity of financial services.
